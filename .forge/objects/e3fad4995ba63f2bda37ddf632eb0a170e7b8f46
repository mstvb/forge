# Forge Documentation

Welcome to the Forge documentation. Forge is a minimal, local version-control tool with a simple CLI focused on snapshots, file tracking, and quick restore flows. It stores data inside a local `.forge` directory in your project.

Quick links:
- Getting Started: [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
- Installation: [Installation](installation.md)
- Concepts: [Concepts](concepts.md)
- Common Workflows: [Workflows](workflows.md)
- Command Reference: [Commands](commands/README.md)
- FAQ: [FAQ](faq.md)
- Troubleshooting: [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

Project links:
- Repository: https://github.com/mstvb/forge
- Issues: https://github.com/mstvb/forge/issues

Note on platform support:
- Examples use Windows-style paths and PowerShell prompts because Forge normalizes paths internally. Forge also works on other platforms; prefer forward slashes in docs where possible.
